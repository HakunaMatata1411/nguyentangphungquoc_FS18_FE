            As the high school entrance exams approach, senior students at Hanoi middle schools find little time to
            sleep or
            eat between back-to-back extra classes.
            Hoang Linh is a ninth grader at a school in Hanoi's Cau Giay District. For the upcoming high-school entrance
            exam in three weeks, Linh has applied to Quang Trung High School in Dong Da District.

            The school set its minimum admission scores at 7.7 points out of 10 for each subject last year. But since
            Linh
            has only been able to score about 7 points in each subject, she cannot help but keep worrying herself sick.

            After her regular classes, Linh takes after-school classes before returning home and studying on her own. On
            average, she spends about 13 hours or more studying every day.

            Linh lives just one km from her middle school, so every day after lunch her father picks her up for a
            half-hour
            nap at home before afternoon classes.

            Linh’s official school-day then does not stop until 5 p.m., when her mother takes her to a private center
            for
            extra classes 5 km from her school.

            When she’s lucky, Linh has time for a rapid dinner or snacks from vendors in front of the school while
            waiting
            for her mother. Often she will eat something while riding on the back seat of her mother’s motorbike. But
            when
            her regular classes run too late, she does not have time to eat anything at all and just has a drink
            instead.
            Linh said that skipping dinner like this is common practice among her peers currently studying for the high
            school entrance exams.

            Linh’s extra classes usually end at 10 p.m., but sometimes later. Normally, Linh gets home at around 11 p.m.

            But she does not go straight to bed. She continues studying for around two more hours. Sometimes she does
            not
            sleep until after the clock strikes 2 a.m.

            At 15, Linh weighs just 35 kg after losing two kilograms in the past week thanks to stress, lack of sleep
            and
            her resulting eating disorder. The girl said many people refuse to believe that she is already a ninth
            grader
            because of her small stature.

            "I'm aware of the tight schedule and the pressure, but I still have to study hard because the exam is
            getting
            closer. I must score one point higher in each subject for a better chance," she said.

            For the upcoming high-school entrance exam, which will take place on June 10-12 in Hanoi, students will have
            tests in the three mandatory subjects of Math, Vietnamese literature and English, as well as one elective
            natural science subject (Physics, Chemistry or Biology), and one elective social science subject (History,
            Geography, or Civic Education).

        <ul>
            <li>1. Vietnam's education standard is lagging far behind many countries. The pressure these students face
                is nothing compared to developed countries.
                Let's get real. Train the students to face more intense pressure and be ready, to succeed in their
                lives.</li>
            <li>2. Why are parents in Vietnam always pushing their children to the limit to study crazy long hours?
                Stressing out is not a healthy way of learning.Maybe the education at State schools should be
                improved,so the kids are educated in a way that they don,t have to do all these extra hours! Our
                daughter is at an International school .</li>
            <li>3. Wow, this system of pushing middle school kids must really work compared to what happens in Europe
                and elsewhere. Definitely makes the people here more well adjusted critical thinkers</li>
            <li>4. No physical activities on the side. Physical activity distress and helps to memorise a lot more
                easier and being productive, less absenteism. The value of the sport and indirects benefits are barely
                seen as zero here.</li>
            <li>5. Studying and hard work rarely amounts to the same advantage simply having natural intelligence can
                bring. Gifted students are those whom things come naturally not those who waste their time trying to
                beat information into their brains.</li>
